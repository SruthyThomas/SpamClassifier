  <h1>Spam Classifier</h1>
</p>

This project implements a spam classifier using various machine learning algorithms and Python libraries. The goal is to classify emails as either spam or non-spam (ham) based on their content. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and the implementation of multiple classification models including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and Naive Bayes Classifier.

## Dataset
  The dataset used in this project consists of labeled email messages, where each message is labeled as either spam or ham. The dataset is preprocessed to remove any irrelevant information 
  and prepare it for training the machine learning models.

 ## Prerequisites
 Python 3.x
 
 Required libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
 
 Jupyter Notebook 

 ## Usage
  Run the provided Jupyter Notebook Spam_Classifier.ipynb to see the step-by-step process of building the spam classifier.
  You can explore various sections of the notebook including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and model building.
  Experiment with different machine learning algorithms and parameters to improve the classifier's performance.
  Use the trained models to classify new email messages as spam or ham.

 ## Project Structure
Spam_Classifier.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and explanations for the entire project.

README.md: This file providing information about the project.

## Results
After training and evaluating the models, you should see the performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 
SVM and Random forest classifier has given best results.
